READ.ME for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data Project
by Shannon Pridgeon, 7/27/14

Hi Everyone,

Here's my project. There is only one script, and it produces both data sets.  The first tidy data set was not turned in but I noted it was complete with comments in the code. I've posted here in my repository all the files required:

readme.txt       I used notepad++
codebook.txt     contains all the codes and a description of what I did
aggdata          my tidy set of aggregated data
run_analysis.R   code

I'm a newbie and I know my code isn't super efficient, but I'm learning!!

Have a great summer.
